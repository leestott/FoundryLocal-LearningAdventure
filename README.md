## 🌐 Play Online Now!

**No installation required!** Play the web version directly in your browser:

👉 **[Play Foundry Learning Adventure](https://leestott.github.io/FoundryLocal-LearningAdventure/)** 👈

The web version includes all 5 levels and works completely in your browser with simulated AI responses.

For the full AI experience, install Foundry Local and start a model. **No port configuration needed** — the game automatically discovers Foundry Local's dynamic port using a 3-tier strategy:

1. **CLI Discovery** — Runs `foundry service status` to find the active endpoint
2. **Configured URL** — Tries the `baseUrl` from `config.json`
3. **Port Scanning** — Falls back to scanning common ports

```bash
# Install Foundry Local
winget install Microsoft.FoundryLocal

# Start a model (the game finds the port automatically)
foundry model run Phi-4
```

## 🌍 Deploy to GitHub Pages

Deploy your own copy of the game to GitHub Pages for free hosting!

### Option 1: Automatic (GitHub Actions) - Recommended

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account

2. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to your repo's **Settings** → **Pages**
   - Source: Select **GitHub Actions**

3. **Push to main branch** - deployment happens automatically!

4. **Access your game** at: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/FoundryLocal-LearningAdventure/`

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

1. **Fork this repository**

2. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to **Settings** → **Pages**
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/game/web`

3. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment

4. **Visit** `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/FoundryLocal-LearningAdventure/`

### Local Testing of Web Version

Test the web version locally before deploying:

```bash
# Navigate to web folder
cd game/web

# Install a simple HTTP server (if needed)
npm install -g http-server

# Start the server
http-server -p 8080 -c-1

# Open in browser
start http://localhost:8080  # Windows
open http://localhost:8080   # macOS
xdg-open http://localhost:8080  # Linux
```

### Web Version Features

The GitHub Pages version includes:
- ✅ All 5 levels with full interactivity
- ✅ AI mentor Sage with helpful responses
- ✅ Progress saved in browser localStorage
- ✅ Badge and achievement system
- ✅ Hint system for each level
- ✅ Mobile responsive design
- ✅ Works completely offline after first load
- ⚠️ Uses simulated AI responses (no real Foundry Local)

For the **full AI experience** with real model responses, use the Node.js terminal version with Foundry Local installed.

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "Node.js not found" or "node is not recognized"

**What happened**: Node.js isn't installed or isn't in your PATH.

**Fix**:
1. Download Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Choose the **LTS** version
3. Run the installer (accept defaults)
4. **Close and reopen your terminal**
5. Try again

---

### "Foundry Local not detected"

**What happened**: The game can't connect to Foundry Local.

**This is OK!** The game will work in "demo mode" with simulated responses.

**To enable full AI**:
1. Open a **new terminal**
2. Install: `winget install Microsoft.FoundryLocal`
3. Start model: `foundry model run Phi-4`
4. **Keep that terminal open**
5. Start the game in a **different terminal**

> **Note**: Foundry Local uses a dynamic port that changes each time it starts. The game automatically discovers the correct port via `foundry service status`. If that fails, it scans common ports (61341, 5272, 51319, 5000, 8080). You do **not** need to configure the port manually.

---

### "Cannot find module" or "MODULE_NOT_FOUND"

**What happened**: Dependencies aren't installed.

**Fix**:
```bash
cd game
npm install
npm start
```

---

### "Progress not saving"

**What happened**: The game can't write to the progress file.

**Fix**:
- Use `quit` command to exit (not Ctrl+C)
- Check that `data/progress.json` exists
- Make sure you have write permission
- Try: `npm run reset` to create a fresh progress file

---

### "Game is frozen" or "Taking too long"

**What happened**: AI call is taking a while.

**Fix**:
- Wait 10-15 seconds (AI can be slow)
- If Foundry Local: check it's still running
- Press Ctrl+C to cancel and try again
- The game will use demo mode if AI is unavailable

---

## 🤔 Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to know programming?

**No!** The game teaches concepts through interaction. You'll learn as you go.

### Do I need internet access?

**No!** Everything runs on your computer. That's what "Local" means.

### Do I need Foundry Local installed?

**No!** The game has a demo mode. But you'll get better responses with it.

### Can I skip levels?

**No**, levels unlock in order. Each one builds on previous concepts.

### How long does it take to complete?

Most people finish in **1-2 hours**. Take your time and enjoy!

### What if I make a mistake?

**No problem!** That's how you learn. Use `hint` or `ask` for help.

### Can I replay completed levels?

**Yes!** Type `play [number]` to replay any level.

### How do I reset my progress?

Type `reset` in the game, or run `npm run reset`.

## 🧪 Running Tests

Make sure everything is working:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Check Foundry Local status (Windows)
npm run test:foundry

# Reset your progress
npm run reset
```

### Running Web Screenshot Tests

Capture screenshots automatically using Playwright:

```bash
# Navigate to game folder
cd game

# Install Playwright (first time only)
npm run test:install

# Capture all screenshots
npm run test:screenshots
```

Screenshots are saved to `game/screenshots/`.

Test output shows:
- ✅ Passed tests (green)
- ❌ Failed tests (red)  
- ⏭️ Skipped tests (yellow - usually means Foundry Local not running)

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit `config.json` to customize:

```json
{
  "foundryLocal": {
    "baseUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:5272",
    "defaultModel": "Phi-4",
    "autoDiscoverPort": true,
    "useCliDiscovery": true,
    "commonPorts": [61341, 5272, 51319, 5000, 8080]
  },
  "azureFoundry": {
    "enabled": false,
    "endpoint": "https://YOUR-RESOURCE.openai.azure.com",
    "apiKey": "YOUR-API-KEY",
    "apiVersion": "2024-02-01",
    "deploymentName": "gpt-4o-mini"
  },
  "game": {
    "maxHintsPerLevel": 3,
    "demoModeEnabled": true
  }
}
```

### Connection Modes

The game automatically detects available AI services:

| Priority | Mode | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| 1 | **Foundry Local** | Uses local AI model (auto-discovers dynamic port via CLI) |
| 2 | **Azure OpenAI** | Uses Azure cloud if configured |
| 3 | **Demo Mode** | Simulated responses (fallback) |

> **Dynamic Port Discovery**: Foundry Local assigns a different port each time it starts. The game automatically discovers the correct port by running `foundry service status`, then falls back to scanning common ports. No manual port configuration is needed.

### Using Azure OpenAI (Cloud)

To use Azure OpenAI instead of local models:

1. **Create an Azure OpenAI resource** at [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. **Deploy a model** (e.g., gpt-4o-mini)
3. **Update config.json**:
   ```json
   {
     "azureFoundry": {
       "enabled": true,
       "endpoint": "https://your-resource.openai.azure.com",
       "apiKey": "your-api-key",
       "deploymentName": "gpt-4o-mini"
     }
   }
   ```
4. Run the game - it will connect to Azure!

### Common Changes

- **Port discovery**: The game auto-discovers Foundry Local's dynamic port. Set `autoDiscoverPort: false` in `config.json` to disable and use a fixed `baseUrl` instead
- **Different model**: Change `defaultModel` to your preferred model
- **More hints**: Increase `maxHintsPerLevel`
